# DroneControl

## Overview

Interactive drone simulator where users aged 11-16 (of any age?) can learn and use basic coding concepts in an accessible and interractive format (Scratch-style blocks or simple code) to command a simulated drone to achieve a goal, e.g. navigation of obstacle course or maze and to engage with control system design in a limited form, e.g. modify parameters in simulation to improve the flight dynamics of a quadcopter.

Intended to support at least 50 concurrent users, scalable to more and to run on Chrome, IE/Edge, Firefox, Safari on Win and Mac. Javascript is used heavily to allow this to scale easily.
