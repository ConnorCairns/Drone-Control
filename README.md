# DroneControl

## Overview

Interactive drone simulator where users aged 11-16 can learn and use basic coding concepts in an accessible format (Scratch-style blocks or simple code) to command a simulated drone to achieve a goal, e.g. navigation of obstacle course or maze.

Intended to support at least 50 concurrent users, scalable to more. Javascript is used heavily to allow this to scale easily.
